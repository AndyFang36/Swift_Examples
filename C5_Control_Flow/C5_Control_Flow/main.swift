/**
 Swift provides a variety of control flow statements.
 These include while loops to perform a task multiple times;
 if, guard, and switch statements to execute different branches of code based on certain conditions;
 and statements such as break and continue to transfer the flow of execution to another point in your code.
 Swift provides a for-in loop that makes it easy to iterate over arrays, dictionaries, ranges, strings, and other sequences.
 Swift also provides defer statements, which wrap code to be executed when leaving the current scope.
